# mocks

This is a tool that mocks Chaordic widgets on a simple HTML page. It only display widgets previously configured on [Central](https://vitrines.chaordic.com.br/). 

## Running
```shell
$ cd mocks
$ npm i 
$ node server.js start
```
Then open http://localhost:3000/. As it works like a normal page, remember to use ?homologation=true to display all widgets.
